# Wii-U-XML-Generator
This program creates a xml file for use with the Wara Wara Plaza from content pulled from reddit

# How do I use this?
You will need a reddit account to use this, as well as a reddit application set up to be a script, you can do that here: https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/
Once you've done that, download the latest release and fill out the name, password, clientID, clientSecret, and appID fields in the config.txt from the zip file in releases. Name and Password are your reddit username and password, the rest of the items come from your reddit application you made in step 5. **Make sure to leave the | in between each item and do not add spaces.** After this, run the .bat file if your running windows, or from your choice of terminal on MacOS or Linux. 

**THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE JAVA INSTALLED, IF YOU DON'T HAVE JAVA INSTALLED IT WILL NOT WORK**

After this, run the bat file in the same directory as the jar and config file, and it should generate the xml file.

To use it on your Wii U, load it with SDCafiine.
Put the xml file in /sdcafiine/0005001010040100/WaraWaraPlaza/content/UsEnglish/Olive/ (for USA systems) on your SD card. 

This has been tested on a version 5.5.3U, you may have to change the name of the folders to get it to work. 

Use at your own risk.
