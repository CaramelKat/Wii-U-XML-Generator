# Wii-U-XML-Generator
This program creates a xml file for use with the Wara Wara Plaza from content pulled from reddit

# How do I use this?
You will need a reddit account to use this, you can do that here: https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/
Once you've done that, you need to fill out the name, password, clientID, clientSecret, and appID fields (in that order) in the main class
After this, build the jar file (I used intelij for this) and run the jar from the command line, it will output the file in the directory it was run in.

To use it on your Wii U, you can use SDCafiine.
put the xml file in /sdcafiine/0005001010040100/WaraWaraPlaza/content/UsEnglish/Olive/ on your SD card. 

This has been tested on a version 5.5.3U, you may have to change the name of the folders to get it to work. 
Use at your own risk.
